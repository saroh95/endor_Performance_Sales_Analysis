# 📊 Vendor Performance & Sales Analysis

## 📁 Overview
This project analyzes vendor sales and inventory performance using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to optimize business decisions in retail/wholesale environments.

> The key objective is to uncover insights that help enhance profitability, streamline inventory, and evaluate vendor efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

- Identify underperforming brands that could benefit from price adjustments or promotions.
- Determine top vendors contributing most to revenue and gross profit.
- Evaluate the impact of bulk purchasing on cost efficiency.
- Analyze inventory turnover to reduce storage costs and increase cash flow.
- Investigate profitability variance between high-performing and low-performing vendors.

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Profit Margins & Sales**: 198 brands showed high margins but low sales — ideal for targeted marketing.
- **Vendor Dependency**: 65.7% of purchases came from the top 10 vendors — a potential supply chain risk.
- **Bulk Purchase Advantage**: Buying in large quantities reduced per-unit costs by up to 72%.
- **Inventory Inefficiencies**: $2.71M worth of inventory remained unsold due to low turnover.
- **Profitability Models**: Statistical tests confirm significantly different profit strategies between vendor groups.

## ✅ Recommendations

- Reprice low-selling, high-margin products to stimulate demand.
- Diversify vendors to avoid over-reliance and reduce risk exposure.
- Use bulk pricing strategically to maintain profitability.
- Clear slow-moving stock and avoid over-purchasing.
- Boost marketing and reach for vendors with limited sales but high profit margins.
